Star Bux: *Player*?
Player: Right here
Player picks up the cup and as they go to take a sip, they notice that Star Bux has written her number on the cup with a winky face
Player: Very fitting that this is how you ask me out.
Star Bux: You don't have any obligation to do so...You can toss the cup and I won't be offended.
Player: Can I think on it?
Star Bux: You can...but my shift ends at 4 so you gotta make it quick.


*Player* leaves starbucks and pulls out their next cupon code for a free fries or salad from Wendy's
